<h3>3 key design patterns</h3>
<p>3 patterns that impact institutions on Canada.ca:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Institutional accessibility plan</li>
  <li>Institutional accessibility feedback process description</li>
  <li>Institutional accessibility feedback mechanism</li>
</ul>
<p>These flow from the requirements under the Accessible Canada Act and Regulations.</p>
<ul>

<p>Publishing deadline: December 31, 2022</p>
<h3>What are accessibility plans?</h3>
<p>A document that outlines an institution's plan regarding the accessibility of all its programs, products, and services. Takes a total view of accessibility, from online to IRL, both public-facing and internal.</p>
<p>The accessibility plan is the first deliverable in a 3-year planning and reporting cycle (annual progress reports to come).</p>
<h3>What is the accessibility feedback process description?</h3>
<p>A published description of how your institutional feedback process works. It must be published alongside your accessibility plan.</p>
<h3>What is the accessibility feedback mechanism?</h3>
<p>A means for the users of an institution's programs and services to provide feedback about any aspect of the accessibility of its programs and services. 
<p>The feedback mechanism must be always available, as feedback processes are meant to be ongoing.</p>
<p>An online form is only one aspect of the feedback mechanism, as people must be able to give feedback by a variety of means.</p>
<h2 id="approach">Recommended approach</h2>
<p>The following working examples represent the recommended approach - not mandatory templates.<p>
<ul>
  <li>Starting point - adjust as needed for your situation</li>
<li>Designed for simplicity and with a focus on top user tasks like providing feedback, reviewing the plan, and understanding the process</li>
  <li>Built with standard WET code elements to maximize WCAG conformance</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Information structure</h3>
  <p>Recommended information architecture for institutional websites</p>
