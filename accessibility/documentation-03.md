    <p>Government departments, agencies and Crown corporations are required to publish an accessibility plan, a feedback process and a feedback mechanism on their websites.</p>
    <p>These templates are designed to help departments implement these requirements in a consistent way.</p>
    <p>The approach and instructions here were presented in November to support web managers implementing these changes.</p>

    <h3>3 key design patterns</h3>
    <p>3 patterns that impact institutions on Canada.ca:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Institutional accessibility plan</li>
      <li>Institutional accessibility feedback process description</li>
      <li>Institutional accessibility feedback mechanism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are derived from the requirements under the Accessible Canada Act and Regulations.</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p><b>Publishing deadline</b>: December 31, 2022</p>
    <h3>What are accessibility plans?</h3>
    <p>A document that outlines an institution's plan regarding the accessibility of all its programs, products, and services. Takes a total view of accessibility, from online to in real life (IRL), both public-facing and internal.</p>
    <p>The accessibility plan is the first deliverable in a 3-year planning and reporting cycle (annual progress reports to come).</p>
    <h3>What is the accessibility feedback process description?</h3>
    <p>A published description of how your institutional feedback process works. It must be published alongside your accessibility plan.</p>
    <h3>What is the accessibility feedback mechanism?</h3>
    <p>A means for the users of an institution's programs and services to provide feedback about any aspect of the accessibility of its programs and services.</p>
    <p>The feedback mechanism must be always available, as feedback processes are meant to be ongoing.</p>
    <p>An online form is only one aspect of the feedback mechanism, as people must be able to give feedback by a variety of means.</p>

    <h2 id="approach">Recommended approach</h2>
    <p>The following working examples represent the recommended approach - not mandatory templates.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Starting point - adjust as needed for your situation</li>
      <li>Designed for simplicity and with a focus on top user tasks like providing feedback, reviewing the plan, and understanding the process</li>
      <li>Built with standard WET code elements to maximize WCAG conformance</li>

      <h4>Design considerations</h4>
      <p>While DTO recommends creating an accessibility node in your institution’s information architecture, it may also make sense to cross-link from elsewhere on your sites, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Linking to the accessibility plan from a “Reports and plans” section</li>
        <li>Linking to the accessibility feedback form from your “Contact us” pages</li>

        <li>Additional doormats can be added as needed</li>
        <li>Other patterns can be used as well on this page (e.g. Most requested band, contextual features)</li>
        <li>Design will likely evolve as future requirements come online, e.g. accessibility statements required under the <a href="https://a11y.canada.ca/en/standards/">proposed ICT accessibility standard</a></li>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="plan.html">Working examples - Accessibility plan</a></p>
      <h3>Design considerations</h3>
      <p>Ensure the plan meets the requirements outlined in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada-regulations-guidance/accessibility-plans.html">Guidance on accessibility plans</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This guidance includes a content template for the plan itself</li>
      </ul>
      <p>People are encouraged to provide feedback on accessibility plans - ensure there is a link to the feedback process and/or feedback form from within the plan itself.</p>
      <p>To assist with findability, TBS is creating a central index for accessibility plans on the <a href="https://open.canada.ca/">Open government site</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Include a link from your plan to the central index</li>
        <li>Submit a metadata record for your plan</li>
        <li>See annex for instructions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27167">Procedures for publishing</a>, institutional accessibility plans are considered publications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request an ISSN and submit a copy to publications.gc.ca</li>
        <li>See annex for instructions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Institutions must notify the Accessibility Commissioner at the Canadian Human Rights Commission within 48 hours of publishing their accessibility plans:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Send an email to Info.Com@chrc-ccdp.gc.ca or use the CHRC’s <a href="https://www.accessibilitychrc.ca/en/notifying-accessibility-commissioner">My Accessibility Portal</a> service</li>
        <li>Include a link or URL for the plan in the email you send</li>

      <h3>Design considerations</h3>
      <p>You will need to hook the intake form up to something - a generic email, a ticketing system, etc. (remember to keep incoming feedback for 7 years!)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AEM users - send a ticket to Principal Publisher to leverage the “file and forget” solution for hooking forms up to an email address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>People submitting feedback have the option to request a response - form design includes information on turnaround times in this scenario.</p>
      <p>Form has been designed to minimize the collection of personally identifiable information (PII):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When the user specifically requests a response, it only asks for an email address</li>
        <li>Includes instructions for users to not include PII in the comment box</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When creating your own implementation, consult with your organization’s ATIP coordinator. </p>

      <h4>Design considerations</h4>
      <p>Designed to focus on top-of-mind user needs, rather than providing an exhaustive description of back-office procedures.</p>
      <p>Ensure the underlying process meets the requirements outlined in Guidance on feedback processes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People must be able to provide feedback by a variety of means, including email, telephone, snail mail</li>
        <li>Feedback must be analyzed and reported on in future</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As with accessibility plans, institutions must notify the Accessibility Commissioner at the Canadian Human Rights Commission within 48 hours of publishing their process description.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Send an email to Info.Com@chrc-ccdp.gc.ca or use the CHRC’s <a href="https://www.accessibilitychrc.ca/en/notifying-accessibility-commissioner">My Accessibility Portal</a> service</li>

    <h3>Procedures for publishing under the Policy on Communications and Federal Identity</h3>
    <p>Since institutional accessibility plans are considered official publications of the Government of Canada, a PDF version of the accessibility plan needs to be included in the <a href="https://publications.gc.ca">catalogue at publications.gc.ca</a>.</p>
    <p>Follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Obtain an ISSN from Library and Archives Canada:<br>
        <a href="https://library-archives.canada.ca/eng/services/publishers/issn/Pages/issn.aspx">International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN)</a></li>
      <li>Obtain a GC catalogue number from PSPC:<br>
        <a href="https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/services/applyForISBN.html">Catalogue numbers - Government of Canada Publications</a></li>
      <li>Put both numbers in your Accessibility plans, as per PSPC guidance on copyright pages:<br>
        <a href="https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/services/formatCopyPage.html">Formatting the copyright page</a></li>
      <li>Submit to PSPC for posting on publications.gc.ca via email:<br>
        publications.acquisitions@pwgsc.gc.ca</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Tip</b>: given the subject matter of the accessibility plan, prepare an accessible PDF.</p>
    <h3>Create a metadata record on open.canada.ca</h3>
    <p>To ensure your institutional accessibility plan is included in the central index on open.canada.ca, you need to submit a metadata record:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a <a href="http://registry.open.canada.ca/">registry account</a>: select <b>Request an Account</b>.  It can take up to 24 hours for the account to be activated.</li>
      <li>Once your account has been created, you will be able to create your record by populating the required metadata.<br>
        <b>Note</b>: you will require your institution’s IMSO approval for releasing a record.  Once approval is given, you will not require an additional approval for future updates.  We do not require you to provide the approval to us.</li>
      <li>Select <b>Create Open Information Asset</b> on the registry landing page.</li>
      <li>Select <b>Institutional Accessibility Plans</b> from the dropdown and complete the metadata fields.<br>
        This form allows you to describe each resource assigned to a dataset or asset.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once completed, your record will be placed in the Open Government Registry publishing queue for review and publication within 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Please contact your institution’s open government representative should you have additional questions about how to publish records to the registry.</p>
